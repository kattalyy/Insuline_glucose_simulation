# Insuline_glucose_simulation
Simulating glucose response to insulin using Taylor approximations and derivatives

## Glucose Taylor Approximation

This project simulates the blood glucose response to insulin over time using a mathematical function, and analyzes it using Taylor series approximations and derivatives.

## Whatâ€™s included

- Simulation of glucose level over time
- 2nd degree Taylor approximation
- Visualization of:
  - True vs. approximated curve
  - Error between curves
  - Rate of glucose change (1st derivative)

## Technologies

- Python (SymPy, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Future ideas

- Add interactivity with ipywidgets
- Use real patient data 
- Extend to more physiological models
